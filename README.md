The odin project - Foundations final project 

Some canvas sizes tend to bug, probably bc of floating point numbers, maybe it would be a better user experience to just force to use 16, 32, 48, 64. But i prefer flexibility.

Project ended (I think) maybe in the future i add some things that i think would be cool

(Maybe) future implementations: 
- Color saver
- Light-mode/Dark-mode
- A revert button would be great, but this is the only thing that i have no f idea how i could make it :(

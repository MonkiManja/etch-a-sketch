The odin project - Foundations final project 
-> At the end turned out to be just a pixel-art drawing tool

Some canvas sizes tend to bug, probably bc of floating point numbers, maybe it would be a better user experience to just force to use 16, 32, 48, 64. But i prefer flexibility.

Now it's working. I didn't like the hover approach for drawing so i took the "click" way. 
It would be great to find a way to drag and click, for the moment it's working (i guess) in this annoying click way.
I implemented a few things that i thought were cool, like the grid, color selector and the pixel size slider.

Didn't check any kind of solution or help from other entries. This is all made by myself.

(Maybe) future implementations: 
- Color saver
- Smoother drawing? 
- Light-mode/Dark-mode
- Rainbow drawing

The odin project - Foundations final project 
-> At the end turned out to be just a pixel-art drawing tool

Now it's working. I didn't like the hover approach for drawing so i took the "click" way. 
It would be great to find a way to drag and click, for the moment it's working (i guess) in this annoying click way.
I implemented i few things that i thought were cool, like the grid, color selector and the pixel size slider.

Didn't check any kind of solution or help from other entries. This is all made by myself.
